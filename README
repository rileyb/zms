== zms == 

zms sends you text messages of Zephyr personals if you have been
inactive on Zephyr. You can use one of two scripts, zms-screen and
zms-logs, depending on how you use Zephyr.


== Requirements and Configuration ==

zms requires python-zephyr. [1]

zms uses configurable information to determine when and how to text
you. This information should be stored in ~/.zmsconf in the following
format (USERNAME and WAIT_TIME only necessary for zms-logs, WAIT_TIME
in seconds):

PHONE_NUMBER=########## 
CARRIER_ADDRESS=carriertext.com
USERNAME=your_zephyr_username       
WAIT_TIME=###

You can find your cell carrier's address on Wikipedia. [2]

=== zms-screen ===

zms-screen determines your activity by utilizing screen's idle
command. To use it, therefore, you need to be running your Zephyr
client in screen and add two lines to ~/.screenrc in the following
format (the first argument of idle is how many seconds screen waits to
go "idle"):

blankerprg /mit/username/yourpath/zms/zms-screen
idle ### blanker

=== zms-logs ===

zms-logs determines your activity by scanning ~/zlog, so to use it you
should enable logging to that directory. Barnowl uses that directory
by default if you enable logging in ./owl/startup with the following
two lines:
    
set classlogging on
set logging on

zms-logs is written keeping in mind users who do not use Zephyr within
screen, so the following are configurations for launching zms-logs
within barnowl. You may find that you prefer using zms-logs over
zms-screen even if you do use screen, though.

In order to launch zms-logs with barnowl, you should copy the contents of
.barnowlconf to your ~/.barnowlconf. 

In order to quit zms-logs when you quit barnowl, you will need to "hook" a
function to the shutdown procedure of barnowl that kills zms-logs. To
do this, copy the contents of zmskill.pm to
~/.owl/modules/zmskill/lib/BarnOwl/Module/zmskill.pm.


== Usage ==

zms-screen will run as long as you have configured your ~/.screenrc
file correctly.

zms-logs can be run as a stand-alone program before or after you
launch barnowl. To run it from within barnowl, follow the relevant
configuration instructions above. You will need to restart barnowl.
