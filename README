== zms.py == 

zms.py sends you text messages of Zephyr personals if you have been
inactive on Zephyr.


== Requirements and Configuration ==

zms.py requires python-zephyr. [1]

zms.py determines your activity by scanning ~/zlog, so you should
enable logging to that directory in your zephyr client. Barnowl uses
that directory by default if you enable logging in ./owl/startup with
the following two lines:
    
set classlogging on
set logging on

zms.py uses personal information to determine when you are away and to
text you. This information should be stored in ~/.zms.conf in the
following format:

USERNAME=your_zephyr_username       
PHONE_NUMBER=########## 
CARRIER_ADDRESS=carriertext.com

You can find your cell carrier's address on Wikipedia. [2]

zms.py determines whether or not you are active on Zephyr by
detecting whether you have sent any Zephyrs in the last WAIT_TIME
seconds. I set WAIT_TIME=180, but you can change it near the top of
zms.py.

== Usage ==

If you have a Zephyr client running in screen, you can just run zms.py
in another window. If you use Kevin Chen's owl-screen, for
convenience's sake, you can also run zms.py in the background by
modifying the ZEPHYR_SCREEN_CLIENT environment variable to include a
wrapper that runs zms.py before launching the Zephyr
client. barnowl-zms-wrapper.sh is such a wrapper that calls Barnowl.
